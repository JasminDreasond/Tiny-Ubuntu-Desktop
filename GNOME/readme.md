## Home Folders
As you mentioned, when you modify (rename / move) Music folder it will point to the new folder.
To force it to point to a different folder, modify file ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs (it's a text file) and set the XDG_MUSIC_DIR parameter to point to your Music.

One can restart GNOME by pressing Alt + F2 together and
entering restart as the command, committed by the ‚èé key.
